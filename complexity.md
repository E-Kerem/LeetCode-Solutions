### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is \(O(m \cdot n \cdot k)\), where:
  - \(m\) is the number of rows in the grid.
  - \(n\) is the number of columns in the grid.
  - \(k\) is the divisor.

This is due to the three nested loops:
- The first two loops go through each cell of the grid; the innermost loop iterates through all possible modulo states.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is also \(O(m \cdot n \cdot k)\) due to the 3D dynamic programming table used to store path counts for each cell and its corresponding modulo state.

Overall, this dynamic programming approach efficiently counts the number of valid paths while respecting computational limits inherent in the problem.
