1. **Time Complexity**: The outer loop runs `n` times and the inner loop runs up to `n` in the worst case, leading to an overall time complexity of \(O(n^2)\).

2. **Space Complexity**: We use an additional array `dp` of size \(n\) to store the lengths of the increasing subsequences. Therefore, the space complexity is \(O(n)\).

By understanding the steps involved in finding the LIS and the conceptual framework surrounding dynamic programming, you will be well-equipped to tackle problems of this nature in the future.
