1. **Time Complexity**:
   - **O(N log N)**: Where N is the total number of entries in `keyTime`. The solution performs a sort operation on the swipe times for each user which takes `O(N log N)`. 
   - The scanning process of each user's swipes after sorting is `O(N)` but is dominated by the sorting term.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - **O(N)**: The space complexity is due to the storage of the swipe times in the hashmap, requiring space proportional to the number of unique users and their swipe times.

In conclusion, the solution efficiently collects, processes, and returns users who have raised alerts based on their key-card usage patterns.
