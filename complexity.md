1. **Time Complexity**: 
   - Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array.
   - The iteration through the elements takes \(O(n)\).
   - Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n + n) = O(n \log n)\).

2. **Space Complexity**: 
   - We are using constant space \(O(1)\) aside from the input storage since we only store a few additional integer variables (`max_size` and `current_sum`).
   - Therefore, the overall space complexity is \(O(1)\).

This thorough explanation should help you understand both the solution and its underlying mechanics effectively.
