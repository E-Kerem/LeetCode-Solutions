The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of increasing subsequences we need to remove from an array so that the remaining elements are not part of any increasing subsequence. Hereâ€™s how we can understand the solution step-by-step:

1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We use a dynamic programming approach to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the input array. We create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` holds the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending with the element `nums[i]`.

2. **Initialization**: Each element is its own increasing subsequence, so we initialize `dp[i] = 1` for all `i`.

3. **LIS Calculation**:
   - We use two nested loops. The outer loop iterates through each element of the array starting from the second element. The inner loop goes from the beginning of the array until the current element of the outer loop.
   - For each pair of indices `(i, j)` where `j < i`, we check if `nums[i] > nums[j]`. If true, this means we can extend the increasing subsequence that ends at `j` to include `i`. Thus, we update `dp[i]` to make sure it holds the maximum length of the increasing subsequence that can end with `nums[i]`.

4. **Finding the Longest Increasing Subsequence**: After filling the `dp` array, the longest increasing subsequence can be found by taking the maximum value from the `dp` array.

5. **Final Calculation**: The minimum number of increasing subsequences we need to remove is the total number of elements `n` minus the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the necessary value to solve the problem.
