1. **Understanding Full Binary Trees**: A full binary tree (FBT) is a type of binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children. For a tree with `n` nodes, `n` must be odd. Therefore, if `n` is even, we can immediately return an empty list since no FBT exists.

2. **Base Case**: If `n` equals `1`, it is the simplest FBT consisting of only one node (the root). This case returns a list containing a single `TreeNode`.

3. **Recursive Construction**: For each odd number of nodes up to `n`, we iterate through possible sizes for the left subtree. The remaining nodes make up the right subtree. The loop runs with `left_nodes` taking values: `1, 3, 5, ..., n-2`.

4. **Generating Subtrees**: For each possible split of nodes into left and right subtrees:
    - Recursively generate all possible left subtrees using `allPossibleFBT(left_nodes)`.
    - Recursively generate all possible right subtrees using `allPossibleFBT(right_nodes)`.
    
5. **Combining Trees**: For each combination of left and right subtree, we create a new tree rooted at a new `TreeNode`, setting the left and right children appropriately, and append this constructed tree to the result list.

6. **Return Result**: Once all combinations for a given `n` have been explored, the function returns the list of possible FBTs.
