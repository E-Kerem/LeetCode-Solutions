1. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**:
   - We create an array `dp` of size `n + 1` to store the minimum number of perfect square numbers required for all integers from 0 to `n`.
   - We initialize each `dp[i]` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, except for `dp[0]`, which will remain 0 since 0 can be represented with 0 perfect squares.

2. **Outer Loop for Each Number**:
   - We iterate through every number from `1` to `n`. For each `i`, we want to determine the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to `i`.

3. **Inner Loop for Perfect Squares**:
   - For each number `i`, we consider each perfect square `j * j` (where `j` starts from `1` and we check `j * j <= i`).
   - The value `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - j * j] + 1`.
     - `dp[i - j * j]` gives us the minimum number of perfect squares needed to form the remainder when subtracting `j * j` from `i`.
     - Adding `1` accounts for including the perfect square `j * j`.

4. **Result**:
   - After filling the `dp` array, `dp[n]` contains the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to `n`.
