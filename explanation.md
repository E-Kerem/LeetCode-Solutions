The solution works by iterating through the provided string `command` and building the final interpreted string using a `StringBuilder`. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**: A `StringBuilder` is used to efficiently build our resulting string.

2. **Iteration through Command**: The code loops through every character in the input string:
   - When a 'G' is encountered, it appends 'G' directly to the result.
   - When a '(' is encountered, it checks what follows:
     - If the next character is ')', it recognizes it as an empty parenthesis that corresponds to 'o' and appends 'o' to the result.
     - If the next character is 'a', it indicates the start of "al", and the characters following (including ')') are processed to append 'al' to the result.

3. **Return the Result**: Finally, after processing the entire command string, the built-up string from `StringBuilder` is converted back to a `String` and returned.
