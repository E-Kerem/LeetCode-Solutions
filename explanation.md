1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing a set called `has_incoming_edges`. This will help us keep track of which vertices have incoming edges.

2. **Iterate through edges**: We loop through each edge (u, v) in the `edges` list. For every edge, we note that the vertex `v` has an incoming edge from vertex `u`, so we add `v` to our `has_incoming_edges` set.

3. **Identify vertices without incoming edges**: Next, we need to identify vertices that do not belong to the `has_incoming_edges` set. These vertices are essential because they do not require any other vertex to reach them and can reach all other nodes.

4. **Collect results**: We iterate over all vertices from `0` to `n-1`, checking if each vertex is in the `has_incoming_edges` set. If a vertex is not present, we append it to the result list.

5. **Return result**: Finally, we return the list of vertices that do not have incoming edges.
