1. **Sorting the Input**: The first step in the solution is to sort the input list `nums`. Sorting helps in trying to add smaller numbers first, ensuring we can maximize the number of elements in the subset without exceeding the limit.

2. **Initializing Variables**: We initialize two variables:
   - `max_size` to count the maximum number of elements we can have in our subset.
   - `current_sum` to keep track of the sum of the selected elements.

3. **Iterating Through Sorted Numbers**: We will iterate through each number in the sorted list:
   - For each `num`, we check if adding this number to the `current_sum` still keeps it less than or equal to 1.
   - If it does, we add `num` to the `current_sum` and increment the `max_size` by 1.

4. **Returning the Result**: After iterating through the numbers, we return the `max_size`, which represents the maximum number of elements allowed in our subset that satisfy the condition.
